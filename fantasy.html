        <h1>7. Army of Darkness</h1>
        <img src="images/army-of-darkness.jpg" alt="">
        <p> When Sam Raimi began his journey with the reluctant hero Ash in the Evil Dead Trilogy, he began with a gritty low budget horror movie. He followed that up with a more comedic horror movie. And finally, he finished the saga off by sending Ash and his magnificent chin to a fantastical realm to have a final showdown with the evil which has been plaguing him. As many of you know, Army of Darkness features Bruce Campbell at his charming best as he accidentally summons an army of Deadites hellbent on attacking a village. Raimi finds a way to bring together; fantasy, horror, and screwball comedy into a single cult classic which is a huge favorite among movie fans.</p><br><br>

        <h1>6. The Fisher King</h1>
        <img src="images/the-fisher.jpg" alt="">
        <p>For years this was a sadly overlooked addition to the filmography of the imaginative Terry Gilliam. But after the tragic passing of its star Robin Williams, this is a movie that has been rediscovered by critics and fans alike. Jeff Bridges is a disgraced shock jock working in a video store with his girlfriend dealing with a deep depression. One night he is rescued from certain death by Robin Williams’ character Parry who is a troubled man haunted by a spectral red knight and searching for the Holy Grail. The former DJ feels responsible for Parry and agrees to help him, with his real quest to help restore the man’s mind. The Fisher King is a highly emotional movie told in the whimsical style that Terry Gilliam has proven the master of.</p><br><br>

        <h1>5. Princess Mononoke</h1>
        <img src="images/princess-mononoke.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Of course one of the masterpiece films from Studio Ghibli would show up on this list. Written and directed by filmmaking legend Hayao Miyazaki delves into many elements of Japanese legend and fantasy as it tells the story of Ashitaka, a prince seeking to free himself from a demon’s curse. While trying to save himself, the prince becomes embroiled in a war to save the forest and the mythical creatures who live within it. Along with a wolf god and human companion Princess Mononoke, Ashitaka tries to find a way to bring peace. Of all of Miyazaki’s films this is probably the most action packed, but the animation legend, never loses focus of the deep and awe-inspiring story.</p><br><br>

        <img src="images/hook.jpg" alt="">

        <h1>2. Beauty and the Beast</h1>
        <img src="images/beauty.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Many have argued that this is the greatest animated film of all time, and it is undoubtedly a cornerstone of the Disney Renaissance. The studio Walt Disney built found tremendous critical and commercial success with their take on this classic French fairy tale.

        <h1>1. Edward Scissorhands</h1>
        <img src="images/edward.jpg" alt="">
        <p>This film more than any others in his filmography epitomizes Tim Burton as a director. An isolated inventor creates for himself a son, but he tragically dies before giving his creation hands, dooming Edward to a life of having blades for hands. Edward goes about his life in a perfectly Burton-esque wonderland until a family brings him into suburbia and tries to integrate him into regular society. Inevitably a deep relationship is forged with the family’s daughter which only leads to heartbreak as it becomes increasingly clear that there is no place for an unique and artistic creature like Edward in a cookie-cutter society. Edward Scissorhands is the perfect showcase Tim Burton’s sensibilities as a filmmaker, and his story perfectly presented with heartfelt performances from Johnny Depp and Wynona Ryder.  This fantasy classic also features the final screen appearance from film icon, Vincent Price.</p><br><br>
