        <h1> 10. BAD BOYS (1995)</h1>
        <img src="images/Bad-Boys-Will-Smith-Martin-Lawrence.jpg">
        <p>Michael Bay's first action movie is free of the bloated excess and undisciplined pacing from most of his
            later output -- we're looking at you, Every. Single. Transformers. Movie. The goal here is to mainline to
            the audience straight-up action movie thrills and two charismatic AF performances from Will Smith and Martin
            Lawrence.<br>The stars play two Miami police officers involved in a case that requires slick cars, lots of
            slow-motion shots, and explosions to solve. While Independence Day is often credited with making Will Smith,
            well, Will Smith, Bad Boys put him on the launch pad for leading man status.</p><br><br>

        <h1>9. DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE (1995)</h1>
        <img src="images/die hard.jpg">
        <p>The best of the Die Hard sequels, With a Vengeance teams Bruce Willis' permanently hung-over cop John McClane
            with law-abiding citizen Zeus (Samuel L. Jackson) as they try to stop a thug (Jeremy Irons) from blowing up
            New York City on his way to stealing a ton of gold from the Federal Reserve. This threequel retrofitted a
            then-popular spec script, "Simon Says," into a Die Hard movie -- bringing back the original's director, John
            McTiernan, to help ground the proceedings in some sense of believability.<br>Gone are the "bad things going
            down on Christmas" trappings, as McClane and Zeus race through NYC streets during a blistering summer heat
            wave. The end result is a sure-plotted actioner that marks the last time John McClane appeared in anything
            resembling a good movie. </p><br><br>

        <h1>8. DESPERADO (1995)</h1>
        <img src="images/desperado-original.jpg">
        <p>Robert Rodriguez's scrappy El Mariachi earned him a chance to upgrade that film's story to fit a decent-ish
            Hollywood budget. Casting then-white hot Antonio Banderas as a guitar player with a case full of guns and a
            vendetta to collect, Rodriguez set out to make his mark on the genre and in studio-filmmaking. The final
            product is a mixed bag; Desperado has inventive gun fights to spare, but the character development hits the
            same one or two notes throughout.<br>That it succeeds at all is a testament to Banderas' charisma, for any
            scene that lacks enough emotional weight to hold up, he more than makes up for with a look or gesture. And
            score bonus for this movie introducing us to Salma Hayek -- who would go on to reprise a version of this
            role in the pseudo-sequel Once Upon a Time In Mexico.</p><br><br>

        <h1>7. MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996)</h1>
        <img src="images/mission-impossible.jpg">
        <p>22 years after Ethan Hunt iconically suspended himself above the NOC-List vault, Tom Cruise reached a
            franchise-high with Summer 2018's hit, Fallout. That film's exceptional success owes it all to the first
            film, one of the series' best. That summer, and for years after, it was almost Hollywood Law that every show
            or movie HAD to parody the aforementioned vault sequence. Like, it was everywhere.<br>Its longevity is a
            testament to director Brian De Palma's assured hand bringing co-writer David Koepp's twisty plot to the
            screen. Also, Tom Cruise's star power. This guy can sell thinking on-screen like no one else, which explains
            in part why Ethan Hunt has endured as a super spy that's neither Bond nor Bourne. He's just a good try
            trying to stop the bad ones, working very hard not to kill anyone in order to do it.</p><br><br>

        <h1>6. THE ROCK (1996)</h1>
        <img src="images/rock-movie.jpg">
        <p>Michael Bay's follow-up to Bad Boys is arguably his best action movie of the '90s -- if not his best movie,
            period. The Rock... it's like one of Stefon's clubs. It has everything: A long-haired Sean Connery,
            fireballs, exploding San Francisco trolly cars, and a scary-good Nicolas Cage.<br>The Oscar-winner's take on
            FBI specialist Stanley Goodspeed is an engaging mix of "aw, shucks" fish-out-of-water likability and bursts
            of badassness, like when the least-likely action hero turns his love for music -- especially his affinity
            for Elton John's "Rocket Man" -- into a prelude to justifiably kill a bad guy with a missile. (Oh, '90s
            action movies. How we miss you.) The plot is the perfect Elevator Pitch: A veteran of the U.S. Armed Forces
            (Ed Harris) takes tourists hostage at Alcatraz, and the only way to get in and save them is to employ the
            services of the only person (Connery) to ever break out of the prison and survive. Connery and Cage's
            dynamic is one of the most entertaining two-handers the genre has ever produced, which is why fans keep
            revisiting this movie annually.</p><br><br>

        <h1>5. AIR FORCE ONE (1997)</h1>
        <img src="images/air-force-one.jpg">
        <p>"Die Hard on the President's plane? Die Hard on the President's plane." This concept is a no-brainer, it's
            also an audience-pleaser -- one of star Harrison Ford's biggest hits. After Kevin Costner passed on and
            recommended Ford for the role of President Marshall, audiences were guaranteed an action flick powered by
            Ford's brand of likable and vulnerable heroics. Gary Oldman chews up nearly all the scenery as one very loud
            and angry Russian thug hellbent on hijacking Air Force One in an effort to force the U.S. to free his former
            leader.<br>Lots of kick-punching ensues, obvi, with the movie giving Ford some of the best fisticuffs of his
            career -- especially a fight in the bowels of his plane. The action and performances hold up for the most
            part, but, sadly, that very bad CG-finale involving the crashing plane still does not.</p><br><br>

        <h1>4. BLADE (1998)</h1>
        <img src="images/blade-via-Empire.jpg">
        <p>Blame this half-human, half-vampire for why we're all living in a Marvel Cinematic Universe. This R-rated
            comic book adaptation from Marvel helped light the fuse on over two decades of content from the comics
            company. Wesley Snipes absolutely owns the character, entering his first scene with the titular vampire
            hunter fully formed. The plot finds Blade trying to stop Deacon "Best Villain Name Ever" Frost from
            resurrecting the Blood God to do, well, very obvious and evil things to those who aren't explosively
            allergic to sunlight.<br>Stephen Norrington's direction indulges in the filmmaker's music video roots to
            present a gritty, gun-metal blue aesthetic that contrasts shockingly sometimes with the movie's generous
            helping of bloody spurts. Horror and action are tricky tones to mesh together, but Blade pulls it off in
            spades. This, and its Guillermo del Toro-directed sequel, are still two of the best Marvel movies ever
            released. </p><br><br>

        <h1>3. RONIN (1998)</h1>
        <img src="images/ronin-movie.jpg">
        <p>This Robert De Niro-led spy thriller is famous for its gritty, done-for-real car chases. They don't so much
            pad the story as they do inform it, providing audiences with legit moments of "holy sh**, how did they pull
            that off?!" -- especially the movie's last big set piece featuring a car chase against traffic through a
            tunnel.<br>Based on a script rewritten by David Mamet (who uses a pen name here), Ronin centers on an De
            Niro's ex-CIA (or is he?) operative who joins a group of individuals with similar skill sets to steal a
            case. Its contents intentionally mysterious -- as all great movie MacGuffins are -- and the stakes
            surrounding the acquiring of it are of the "failure is not an option" variety. Given the recent emphasis on
            gritty espionage on the big screen, thanks to Bourne movies and recent Bond adventures, Ronin has aged well
            as sort of a precursor to the current climate. And who knew De Niro could pull off being a gun-toting action
            hero so well?</p><br><br>

        <br><br>
        <h1>2. ENEMY OF THE STATE (1998)</h1>
        <img src="images/enemy-state.jpg">
        <p>Pound for pound, dollars-to-donuts, this 1998 hit is arguably Will Smith's most underrated Hollywood effort.
            It is also one of the most underrated movies on late director Tony Scott's resume. The still-timely plot
            involving government surveillance on private citizens, including Smith's on-the-run lawyer fighting to stay
            one step ahead of a conspiracy closing in on him, feels more relevant now than it did 21 years ago.<br>Scott
            borrows loosely from similar paranoid thrillers like The Conversation and The Parallax View, delivering a
            surprisingly restrained (for him) exercise in maximum tension grounded by a very likable and relatable lead
            performance from Smith. Enemy of the State was the type of movie perfect for rainy day video store rentals
            or for watching on TNT. If you haven't seen this movie ever, or have been eager to revisit it, seek it out.
            Come for the Will Smith, stay for cranky Gene Hackman!</p><br><br>

        <h1>1. THE MATRIX (1999)</h1>
        <img src="images/the-matrix-post.jpg">
        <p>Warner Bros. had no idea they would have a zeitgeist-making franchise on their hands, let alone a runaway box
            office hit, when they all but dumped The Matrix into theaters during the spring of 1999. Word-of-mouth
            quickly spread, sending people into theaters for the third or fourth time to watch Keanu Reeves give birth
            to his signature character. As Neo, Reeves' low-wattage is an asset, especially as we uncover that his
            office drone is trapped inside a computer simulation because machines have destroyed and taken over the
            world.<br>What ensues is both visual feast (yay, Bullet Time!) and thematically rich, there are as many
            action scenes as their are textual and subtextual philosophical debates regarding the cost of simulacra and
            the allure of real-life. As cool as it is to "know Kung Fu" via brain download, or battle Agents inside the
            gravity-be-damned Matrix, it's even cooler to revisit this landmark film if you haven't watched it in a
            while. This is one first-time we wish we could get back.</p><br><br>
